    "## Fundamentals of Computer Programming Languages \n",
    "There are a few things we should learn before jumping into the Python itself. Therefore, in this notebook, we are going to learn some basics about Programming Languages, how they work and probably a little bit about architecture! Don't worry too much, I try my best to explain as well as possible.\n",
    "I should also note that, this notebook is not based on the Programming languages fundamentals that a CS student would learn. I just mention the things that they might be necessary or helpful for our journey in python in the future."
