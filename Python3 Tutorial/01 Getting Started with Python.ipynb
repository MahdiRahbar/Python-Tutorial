    "Python is a widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose programming, created by Guido van Rossum and first released 1991. Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional programming, and procedural styles. It has a large and comprehensive standard library.\n",

    "* Python 2.x is the legay version and will recieve only security updates until 2020. No new features will be implemented.\n",

    "In this tutorial we will use python 3.x. You can find a guide on how to install Python3 in [this repository](file://./Installing%20Python%20Environment.pdf) or check [Python's website](https://www.Python.org). \n",

    "It is worth saying that, in this tutorial, we will install the packages manually so we can get a better intuition for the future advanced concepts. However, if you already installed Python via package mangement tools such as Anaconda, Don't worry! But if you have not, I hightly recommend you to install Python 3 manually by downloading the corrosponding Python isntallation file to your computer's OS from its [website](https://www.Python.org).\n"
