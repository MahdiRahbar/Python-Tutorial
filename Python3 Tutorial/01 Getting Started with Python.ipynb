    "Python is a widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose programming, created by Guido van Rossum and first released 1991. Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional programming, and procedural styles. It has a large and comprehensive standard library.\n",

However, if you already installed Python via package mangement tools such as Anaconda, Don't worry! But if you have not, I hightly recommend you to install Python 3 manually by downloading the corrosponding Python isntallation file to your computer's OS from its [website](https://www.Python.org).\n"
